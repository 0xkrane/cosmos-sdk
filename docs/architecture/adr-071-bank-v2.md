## Abstract

The primary objective of refactoring the bank module is to simplify and enhance the functionality of the Cosmos SDK. Over time the bank module has been burdened with numerous responsibilities including transaction handling, account restrictions, delegation counting, and the minting and burning of coins. 

In addition to the above, the bank module is currently too rigid and handles too many tasks, so this proposal aims to streamline the module by focusing on core functions `Send`, `Mint`, and `Burn`.

Currently, the module is split accross different keepers with scattered and duplicates functionalities (with 4 send functions for instance).

Additionally, the integration of the token factory into the bank module allows for standardization, and better integration within the core modules.

This rewrite will reduce complexity and enhance the efficiency and UX of the bank module.

## Context

The current implementation of the bank module is characterised by its handling of a broad array of functions, leading to significant complexity in using and extending the bank module. 

These issues have underscored the need for a refactoring strategy that simplifies the moduleâ€™s architecture and focuses on its most essential operations.

Additionally, there is an overlap in functionality with a Token Factory module, which could be integrated to streamline oper.

## Decision

**Permission Tightening**: Access to the module can be restricted to selected denominations only, ensuring that it operates within designated boundaries and does not exceed its intended scope. Currently, the permissions allow all denoms, so this should be changed. Send restrictions functionality will be maintained.

**Simplification of Logic**: The bank module will focus on core functionalities `Send`, `Mint`, and `Burn`. This refinement aims to streamline the architecture, enhancing both maintainability and performance.

**Integration of Token Factory**: The Token Factory will be merged into the bank module. This consolidation of related functionalities aims to reduce redundancy and enhance coherence within the system. Migrations functions will be provided for migrating from Osmosis' Token Factory module to bank/v2.

**Legacy Support**: A legacy wrapper will be implemented to ensure compatibility with about 90% of existing functions. This measure will facilitate a smooth transition while keeping older systems functional.

**Callback Functions**: We propose to integrate callback functions directly to the x/bank module, allowing for customisable behaviour during minting, burning and transferring operations without complicating statemanagement. It provides a streamlined approach to asset management and allows for the customisation of asset behaviors while maintaining a unified state management system.

Implementation of Callback Functions:

```go
type BankKeeper struct {
    OnMint func(ctx context.Context, addr []byte, amount sdk.Coin) error
    OnBurn func(ctx context.Context, addr []byte, amount sdk.Coin) error
    OnTransfer func(ctx context.Context, fromAddr, toAddr []byte, amount sdk.Coin) error
    OnBalanceOf func(ctx context.Context, addr []byte, denom string) (sdk.Coins, error)
}

func (k *BankKeeper) MintCoins(ctx context.Context, moduleName string, amt sdk.Coins) error {
    if k.OnMint != nil {
        if err := k.OnMint(ctx, moduleName, amt); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
}

func (k *BankKeeper) BurnCoins(ctx context.Context, moduleName string, amt sdk.Coins) error {
    if k.OnBurn != nil {
        if err := k.OnBurn(ctx, moduleName, amt); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
}

func (k *BankKeeper) SendCoins(ctx context.Context, fromAddr, toAddr []byte, amt sdk.Coins) error {
    if k.OnTransfer != nil {
        if err := k.OnTransfer(ctx, fromAddr, toAddr, amt); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
}

func (k *BankKeeper) GetBalance(ctx context.Context, addr []byte, denom string) (sdk.Coins, error) {
    if k.OnBalanceOf != nil {
        coins, err := k.OnBalanceOf(ctx, addr, denom);
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }

        return coins, err
    }
}
```

Messages for Admin Operations:
To facilitate admin operations like `Mint`, `Burn`, and `Move`, we can define specific messages that can be invoked by the admin account of each denom. These operations will be internal and not exposed to end clients directly.

```protobuf
message Mint {
  string denom = 1;
  string to = 2;
  string amount = 3;
}

message Burn {
  string denom = 1;
  string from = 2;
  string amount = 3;
}

message Move {
  string denom = 1;
  string from = 2;
  string to = 3;
  string amount = 4;
}
```

If admin account defines these callbacks, `x/bank` will call `x/accounts` `MsgExecute` with the `OnTransfer`, `GetBalance` or `GetSupply` callbacks:

```protobuf 
// can error if transfer isn't allowed
message OnTransfer {
  string denom = 1;
  string from = 2;
  string to = 3;
  string amount = 4;
}

// returns GetBalanceResponse
// can override state management in x/bank
// otherwise x/bank manages balance state
// if GetBalance is defined, GetSupply also needs to be defined

message GetBalance {
  string denom = 1;
  string account = 2;
}

message GetBalanceResponse {
  string amount = 1;
}

message GetSupply {
  string denom = 1;
}

message GetSupplyResponse {
  string amount = 1;
}
```

x/bank is responsible for emitting send, mint and burn events for consistency.

## Migration Plans

Bank is a widely used module, so getting a v2 needs to be thought thoroughly. In order to not force all dependencies to immediately migrate to bank/v2, the same _upgrading_ path will be taken as for the `gov` module.

This means `cosmossdk.io/bank` will stay one module and there won't be a new `cosmossdk.io/bank/v2` go module. Instead the bank protos will be versioned from `v1beta1` (current bank) to `v2`.

Bank `v1beta1` endpoints will use the new bank v2 implementation for maximum backward compatibility.

The bank `v1beta1` keepers will be deprecated and potentially eventually removed, but its proto and messages definitions will remain.

Additionally, as bank plans to integrate token factory, migrations functions will be provided to migrate from Osmosis token factory implementation (most widely used implementation) to the new bank/v2 token factory.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Simplified interaction with bank APIs
* Backward comptible changes (no contracts or apis broken)
* Optional migration (note: bank `v1beta1` won't get any new feature after bank `v2` release)

### Neutral

* Asset implementation not available cross-chain (IBC-ed custom asset should possibly fallback to the default implementation)
* Many assets may slow down bank balances requests

### Negative

* Temporarily duplicate functionalities as bank `v1beta1` are `v2` are living alongside
* Difficultity to ever completely remove bank `v1beta1`
